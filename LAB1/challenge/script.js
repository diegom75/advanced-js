/// The three siblings get their allowance once a week.

/// a. Adds 2 numbers and returns the sum

/// c. If the number is even, return the number divided by 2, otherwise, return the number
/// For example reduceEvens(10) => 5 -- reduceEvens(11) => 11
const reduceEvens = (x) => {
  // if( ){
  // } else {

//Write your own function calls

// 14. Write a function called shortenString(string) that returns the first 10 characters of a string if it is longer than 10
//remove all
const shortenString = (string) => {};

// Spicy Challenges

// 15. Write a function buyBurgers(budget) that takes in a budget amount and returns the number of burgers that can be bought.
// Prompt the user for their budget and call the function.
/// If no burgers, fries, and sodas can be bought, return "Sorry, no burgers for you."

// Prompt the user for their budget and call the function.
/// Bonus: Round the answer to the nearest penny.
const buyMeals = (budget) => {};

// 17. [Challenge] Write a function missingLeg(side1, side2) that takes in the length of a hypotenuse and a leg of a right triangle and prints out the missing leg's length
// Prompt the user for the two sides and call the function
/// The larger side should be the hypotenuse

// 18. [Super Challenge] In math, Factorial is the product of an integer and all the integers below it.
/// For example: factorial(3) = 3*2*1 = 6 ---  factorial(5) = 5*4*3*2*1 = 120
/// Write a function factorial(x) that finds the factorial of any integer.
// Prompt the user for a number and call the function
